## Unreleased

## [2.0.0] â€“ 2024-12-21

- Modernize the gem setup [#5](https://github.com/liveh2o/strong_routes/pull/5)
- Make Allow middleware thread-safe without duping (85x faster!) [#6](https://github.com/liveh2o/strong_routes/pull/6)
- Return 404 HEAD response by default (if `public/404.html` is present in Rails apps, it is rendered instead) [#7](https://github.com/liveh2o/strong_routes/pull/7)
- Automatically reload allowed routes in Rails apps when routes change (in development mode)
- Use Standard styles

### Added

- Add config options for `:content`, `:content_type`, and `:status`. If `:content` is nil (the default), no headers will be returned. Otherwise, a `content-type` header will be added. If `:content_type` is nil (the default), `"text/plain"` will be used.

### Changed
